# CS5691-PRML
CS5691 is course on Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, offered by the Computer Science Department at IIT Madras.
This repository contains solutions to all the assignments that students were asked to do in this course during the Jan-May 2020 semester. </br>
## Assignment 1 - In this assignment, the following ML algorithms and ideas were built and explored using Python:</br>
* Binary Bayes Classifier with Max. Likelihood
* Multi-class Bayes Classifier with Max. Likelihood
* Bias-Variance analysis in regression
* Analyse overfitting and underfitting in Regression
# Assignment 2 - In this assignment, the following ML algorithms and ideas were built and explored using Python:</br>
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forests </br>
(All the above mentioned models were built from scratch using Python and Numpy)</br>
# Final Project </br>
The given problem is about predicting whether an employee is going to leave
the company or not in the coming few months. The data collected is about the
ratings and remarks given by the employees of different companies on a single
platform, where the employees can participate according to their choice. </br>
**Feature Engineerning, Model building and hyper-parameter tuning using K-fold cross validation was done to solve the problem (Random forest model performed the best)**
